## Intro
Inspired by short-form events like the [3 Minute Thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Minute_Thesis), a 1 hour data analysis is meant to be a challenge in creating a focused and succinct data analysis in just 1 hour.

There are so many ways that data can be used, and this depends in part on the communities using data and the tools used to manipulate data (if you're interested more in this relation between communities, tools, and uses of data, I have the perfect dissertation for you üòÅ). Data analysts, however, likely never have all the time we want to be able to sift through a dataset to our heart's content. When a content creator on Twitter chatted with me about their engagement analytics, this 1 hour analysis idea was born.

The time limit forces a data analyst to narrow down the topic of analysis to a single, specific question. Cleaning is performed only with that question in mind, and visuals must directly relate to that question. The end result is a straightforward executive report.

The aim of this challenge isn't to say that analyses are quick‚Äîthey're anything but that. Instead, the aim of this challenge is to show that in the realm of possibilities, every minute counts.

This repository will contain the executive summaries of my 1 hour analyses.
